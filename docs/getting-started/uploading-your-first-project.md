# Uploading the First Project

After setting everything up, itâ€™s time to upload our first project to the MYOSA motherboard. We'll start with a simple program that makes the status LED on the MYOSA motherboard blink at 1-second intervals.

1. Open **Arduino IDE**.
2. Connect your **MYOSA Motherboard** using a **USB C cable**.
