# How to Connect Boards

## Must Have

- A **MYOSA Motherboard**
- **USB cable** - USB C type
- Computer running **Windows** with **Arduino IDE**

### Other Products (Necessary depending on requirements)

- **Accelerometer + Gyroscope Sensor**
- **Barometric Pressure Sensor**
- **Temperature and Humidity Sensor**
- **Gesture + RGB Sensor**
- **Air Quality Sensor**

## Connection Guidance

   ![Step 1 Image](./images/image11.jpg)

Using a **JST 4-wire cable** and simple stacking, you can easily connect as many sensors as you need. How easy was that? Right! With just a few steps, all our hardware is connected.

For real-time monitoring, you'll also need an **OLED display** to visualize the sensor data. If you want to control external devices, you will need an **actuator**.

Lastly, connect the motherboard using a **Type C USB cable** to the computer.

All done! Now let's upload our first project.
