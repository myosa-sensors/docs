# Adding MYOSA Libraries into Arduino IDE

## What is a Library ?

Libraries are a collection of code that makes it easy for you to connect to a sensor, display, module, etc. Libraries make it easy to read sensor values without getting into the actual code. To use any library, you will need to download and install that.


1. Go to the [MYOSA Libraries GitHub page](https://github.com/pegasus-automation/myosa). Click on **Code** and then click on **Download ZIP**.

2. Extract the ZIP file. This will give you a folder named `myosa-main`, and inside it, you will find other folders as shown below.

3. Select all the folders inside the `myosa-main` folder, copy them, and paste them into your `Documents -> Arduino -> libraries` folder.

4. If the Arduino IDE is already open, close and reopen it. You will find the MYOSA examples in **File -> Examples -> MYOSA**.
