1. Open the **Arduino IDE 2**.

3. Open your browser and go to [Installing - Arduino ESP32 latest documentation](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/installing.html#installing-using-arduino-ide) and copy the Stable release link.

5. Now, in the left column, click on the **Arduino board** icon. This will open a side window. Type `esp32` in the search field. We have to install the one named **esp32** by Espressif Systems, so just click the **INSTALL** button for that package.
