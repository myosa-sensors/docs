### Code Uploading Circuit with TX/RX LEDs

- The board is equipped with a USB-to-serial converter, allowing code uploads via a USB-C port.
- TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive) LEDs indicate when data is being sent or received, providing visual feedback during code uploading.

### Reset and Boot Buttons

- The Reset button allows you to reboot the ESP32 without disconnecting the power.
- The Boot button is used for flashing the ESP32 with new firmware.

### 3.3V Power LED

- A 3.3V power LED indicates that the board is powered on and receiving a stable voltage supply, ensuring correct power for sensors and actuators.

### Programmable Blue LED at GPIO2

- The board features a programmable blue LED connected to GPIO2, controllable through code for debugging, status indication, or as part of the projectâ€™s user interface.

### Extra GPIOs via Female Bergstrip Headers

- The board includes extra GPIO pins accessible through female Bergstrip headers for easy connection of additional sensors or peripherals.

### USB-C Port for Code Uploading and Powering

- A USB-C port is provided for both code uploading and powering the board, ensuring reliable and fast communication with your computer.

### Reverse Polarity Protection (Diode)

- Reverse polarity protection via a diode prevents damage from incorrect power connections.

### ESD Protection

- Electrostatic discharge (ESD) protection safeguards sensitive components like the ESP32 from static discharge, ensuring long-term durability.

### I2C Port

- A dedicated I2C port simplifies wiring and ensures efficient communication between the microcontroller and peripherals, such as sensors and an OLED display.

## Code Guide

### Master Code Explanation

This code is part of the MYOSA (LearnTheEasyWay) initiative, designed to help students understand how to work with an ESP32-based controller, various sensors, an OLED display, and an actuator board.

#### Libraries and Class Creation

```cpp
/* Library Inclusion */
#include <myosa.h>

/* Create Object of MYOSA class */
MYOSA myosa;
```

- **Library Inclusion:** Includes the `myosa.h` library developed for the MYOSA platform to handle sensor and actuator operations.
- **MYOSA Object Creation:** Creates an object `myosa` from the `MYOSA` class to manage the different modules and their data.

#### Global Constants and Variables

```cpp
/* Set the timer to zero */
unsigned long previousMillis = 0;

/* Global Constants */
const long perModuleInterval = 1500;
uint8_t nScreen = 0u;
```

- **previousMillis (Timer):** Tracks the last time the screen was updated.
- **perModuleInterval:** Defines the interval between screen updates (1.5 seconds).
- **nScreen:** Tracks the module currently displayed on the OLED screen.

#### setup() Function

```cpp
void setup() {
  /* Setting up communication */
  Serial.begin(115200);
  Wire.begin();
  Wire.setClock(100000);

  /* Initialize all modules */
  Serial.println(myosa.begin());
}
```

- **Serial and I2C Setup:** Configures communication with sensors using the I2C protocol.
- **Module Initialization:** Initializes all connected sensors and prints the result for debugging.

#### loop() Function

```cpp
void loop() {
  unsigned long currentMillis = millis();
  if (currentMillis - previousMillis >= perModuleInterval) {
    previousMillis = currentMillis;
    switch (nScreen) {
      case 0u:
        myosa.printAceelAndGyro();
        nScreen = 1u;
        break;
      // Additional cases...
      default:
        nScreen = 0u;
        break;
    }
    myosa.sendBleData();
  }
}
```

- **Time Check (currentMillis):** Checks if the interval has passed, then updates the screen.
- **Switch Statement:** Cycles through different modules, displaying sensor data on the OLED screen.
- **BLE Data Transmission:** Sends sensor data to the mobile app via BLE.

### Key Learning Points

- **Sensor Management:** Learn to initialize, read, and display sensor data using a microcontroller.
- **I2C Communication:** Demonstrates how to establish communication with sensors via the I2C protocol.
- **OLED Display:** Displays multiple data readings on an OLED screen in a timed manner.
- **BLE Data Transmission:** Introduces wireless data transmission via BLE.

The MYOSA kit provides hands-on experience with embedded systems and IoT devices, making it ideal for educational purposes.
